# docker_registries:
#   # Authenticate to the Docker Hub, and allow the "admin" system user acces to it:
#   - username: "your_docker_hub_username"
#     password: "your_docker_hub_password"
#     email: "your_docker_hub@emailaddress.com"
#     system_user: "{{ docker_users | first }}"
#   # Authenticate to some other private registry and allow "zerocool":
#   - registry_url: "https://your-registry.com"
#     username: "some_other_username"
#     password: "some_other_password"
#     system_user: "zerocool"
#   # Disable logging in to some old registry you don't use anymore:
#   - registry_url: "https://old-registry.com"
#     username: "some_old_username"
#     password: "some_old_password"
